    <h3>Good</h3>
    <p>
        Why i choose these websites is because of there simplistic nature and how even someone that hates computer can use them. Both website
        basically shows or walks you threw them. Facebooks basically spells it out and you learn as you go. While Google is simple serach and go.
    </p>
    <h3>Bad</h3>
    <p>
    These websites have no oraganization and is hard to find what your
    looking for or to complete your task.
