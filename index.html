          <h3>Lab 2</h3>
          
          <p>In the project we learn how css changes the web page.</p>
          <p>Because of my early labs i moved css to another page.</p>
          <p>We also learn how to link the web pages</p>

          <h3>Lab 3</h3>
          <p>In this project i learn how to connect web pages.</p>
          <p>To be honest i learn how to organize everything (html, css, Java)</p>

          <h3>Lab 4</h3>
          <p>In this project i learn you can add multiple css pages.</p>
          <p>I see add more then one is easier for me.</p>
          <p>We also learned about flex box and grid. I think i like flexbox better but learning grid first</p>
          <p>This project was harder for me and i spent as much time as i could just leaning grid</p>
